# BackgridJS Total Footer

This is a simple wrapper around [backgridjs-total-footer](https://bitbucket.org/base79/backgridjs-total-footer/overview).

## Why is it needed?
As noted in the project, bower, currently, requires a git:// style link, however bitbucket doesn't support this.

This is a simple wrapper around the bitbucket hosted project.

## Usage
```bash
bower install backgridjs-total-footer-bower --save
```
